Educational C++ toolkit for safe analysis, logging, and offline modding research â€” ethical, non-exploitative.
# ðŸ”Ž Volcano Key Systems â€” Educational Analysis (Research)

> **Disclaimer:** This repository is strictly for **educational**, **ethical research**, and **defensive analysis** purposes. It does **not** contain tools, exploits, or instructions to bypass authentication, fraud-prevention, anti-cheat, or any other protection systems. Do not use the material here to attempt unauthorized access or to disrupt services. Always act in accordance with applicable laws and platform Terms of Service.

## About this project
This repository contains analytical materials and safe demonstrations related to the concepts of activation/key systems, verification models, and defensive patterns. The goal is to study architectures, raise awareness, and develop protective measures in learning/test environments.

## Contents
- `docs/` â€” articles and diagrams explaining key-system concepts, threat models, and protection strategies.  
- `research/` â€” high-level descriptions and pseudocode for protocols (theoretical only; no bypass procedures).  
- `tools/` â€” safe utilities for controlled simulations (log generation, test datasets, parsers).  
- `ethics.md` â€” ethics & responsible disclosure policies (required reading for contributors).

## Research guidelines
- Perform research **only** in controlled, isolated environments using non-production/copied data.  
- Do **not** publish or distribute bypass techniques, exploit code, or step-by-step instructions to defeat protections.  
- If you discover a real vulnerability, follow the Responsible Disclosure steps in `ETHICS.md` and contact the service owner privately.  
- Always comply with applicable laws and the serviceâ€™s Terms of Service.

## How to use this repository (educational)
1. Read `docs/` to learn about architectures and threat models.  
2. Use `tools/` to create test data and practice log analysis in an offline lab.  
3. Record results in `research/` as high-level writeups; avoid publishing exploitable details.

## Contributing
Contributions that increase educational value are welcome (documentation, analysis, tooling for safe testing). All contributions must adhere to `ETHICS.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## License
Materials are provided under MIT + Ethical Use Clause. Use for learning and defensive research only; use that harms others or bypasses protections is prohibited.
